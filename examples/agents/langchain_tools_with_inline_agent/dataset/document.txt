One final investment area that I’ll mention, that’s core to setting Amazon up to invent in every area of our
business for many decades to come, and where we’re investing heavily is Large Language Models (“LLMs”)
and Generative AI. Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades, but it’s
only been the last five to ten years that it’s started to be used more pervasively by companies. This shift was
driven by several factors, including access to higher volumes of compute capacity at lower prices than was ever
available. Amazon has been using machine learning extensively for 25 years, employing it in everything
from personalized ecommerce recommendations, to fulfillment center pick paths, to drones for Prime Air,
to Alexa, to the many machine learning services AWS offers (where AWS has the broadest machine learning
functionality and customer base of any cloud provider). More recently, a newer form of machine learning,
called Generative AI, has burst onto the scene and promises to significantly accelerate machine learning
adoption. Generative AI is based on very Large Language Models (trained on up to hundreds of billions
of parameters, and growing), across expansive datasets, and has radically general and broad recall and
learning capabilities. We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now, believe it will transform and
improve virtually every customer experience, and will continue to invest substantially in these models
across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences. Additionally, as we’ve done for years in
AWS, we’re democratizing this technology so companies of all sizes can leverage Generative AI. AWS is
offering the most price-performant machine learning chips in Trainium and Inferentia so small and large
companies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production. We enable companies to choose from
various LLMs and build applications with all of the AWS security, privacy and other features that customers
are accustomed to using. And, we’re delivering applications like AWS’s CodeWhisperer, which revolutionizes
developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time. I could write an entire letter on LLMs
and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I’ll leave that for a future letter. Let’s just
say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.
